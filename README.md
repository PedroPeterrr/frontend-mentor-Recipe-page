## Overview

This project focuses on strengthening my foundational skills in HTML and CSS. It helped me improve my understanding of proper HTML structure, CSS styling, and layout techniques.
Throughout the project, I learned how to organize elements, use correct nesting, work with tables table, tr, td, and customize list styles and colors.

I also practiced working with imports, applying Google Fonts, adjusting padding and margins, and following a style guide to maintain consistency across the design.
As a next step, I aim to work on a semi-big project that involves behavior, animations, and transitions to further enhance my skills.

Overall, this project was a great experience to reinforce the basics and prepare for more advanced front-end challenges.

Additionally, I learned the importance of proper nesting of elements to keep the code clean and organized.
Finally, I gained more experience working with tables, including using table, tr, and td, and styling them effectively.
